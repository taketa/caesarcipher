Description: langdetect
        ==========
        
        Port of [language-detection](https://code.google.com/p/language-detection/) (version from 03/03/2014) library to Python.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
            $ pip install langdetect
        
        
        Supported Python versions 2.6, 2.7, 3.x.
        
        
        Basic usage
        ===========
        
        To detect the language of the text:
        
            >>> from langdetect import detect
            >>> detect("War doesn't show who's right, just who's left.")
            'en'
            >>> detect("Ein, zwei, drei, vier")
            'de'
        
        To find out the probabilities for the top languages:
        
            >>> from langdetect import detect_langs
            >>> detect_langs("Otec matka syn.")
            [sk:0.572770823327, pl:0.292872522702, cs:0.134356653968]
        
        **IMPORTANT**
        
        Language detection algorithm is non-deterministic, which means that if you try to run it on a text which is either too short or too ambiguous, you might get different results everytime you run it.
        
        To enforce consistent results, call following code before the first language detection:
        
            from langdetect import DetectorFactory
            DetectorFactory.seed = 0
        
        
        More information
        ================
        
        This library is a direct port of [language-detection](https://code.google.com/p/language-detection/) from Java to Python. All the classes and methods (even unit tests) are unchanged, so for more information see the project's website or wiki.
